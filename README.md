## 📘 Component Documentation

This project includes full Storybook support with Chromatic for:

- 🧩 **Visual regression testing**
- 🧪 **Autodocs & interaction testing**
- 🧱 **Atomic design structure**
- 🧼 **Lint-safe UI development workflow**

### Run Storybook:

```bash
yarn storybook
```

### Test Snapshots with Chromatic:

```bash
yarn chromatic
```

---

## 💥 Error Handling

Includes a custom `ErrorBoundary` component that:

- Catches client-side rendering errors
- Shows an animated fallback with options:
  - 🔁 Reload page
  - 🏠 Go to homepage
  - 🐛 Open GitHub issue

✅ Also tested with Storybook via `ErrorThrowingComponent`.

---

## 🔀 Lazy Routing & Suspense

Dynamic routing is enabled via `React.lazy()` and `Suspense`:

```tsx
const Home = lazy(() => import("../pages/Home"));
```

Wrapped in a `LazyWrapper` component that shows a fallback while loading:

```tsx
<Suspense fallback={<div className="text-center py-10">Loading...</div>}>
  <Outlet />
</Suspense>
```

---

## 📦 Scripts

```bash
yarn dev             # Start dev server (Vite)
yarn build           # Production build
yarn preview         # Preview the built site locally
yarn storybook       # Run Storybook
yarn chromatic       # Push Storybook to Chromatic
yarn lint            # Run ESLint
```

---

## 🌍 Deployment (GitHub Pages)

Production builds are deployed to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions.

> `vite.config.ts` uses `base: '/'` for correct public paths.

```ts
export default defineConfig({
  base: '/',
  plugins: [...],
});
```
